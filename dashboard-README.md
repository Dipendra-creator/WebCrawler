# Web Crawler Dashboard

A beautiful web dashboard for visualizing and exploring data generated by the Playwright Web Crawler.

## Features

- View crawl statistics and metadata
- Browse crawled pages and their details
- View screenshots in a gallery format
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile

## Overview

This dashboard provides a user-friendly interface to explore data collected by the Playwright Web Crawler. It displays statistics about the crawl, lists all crawled pages with their details, and shows screenshots of the crawled pages in a gallery view.

## Files

- **main.html**: The main dashboard that dynamically loads data from PHP backends
- **main-static.html**: A static demo version that works without PHP (using sample data)
- **getLatestCrawlData.php**: PHP script to fetch the latest crawl data
- **getScreenshots.php**: PHP script to fetch the screenshots
- **dashboard-README.md**: This documentation file

## Usage

### Using the Dashboard with PHP

1. Run the Playwright Web Crawler to generate crawl data:
   ```bash
   python examples/simple_crawl.py
   ```

2. Place the dashboard files in a directory served by a PHP-enabled web server.

3. Open `main.html` in your browser.

### Using the Static Demo

If you don't have a PHP-enabled web server, you can still use the static demo:

1. Open `main-static.html` in your browser.
2. This will load sample data to demonstrate the dashboard functionality.

## Requirements

For the main dashboard:
- Web server with PHP 7.0+ support
- Browser with JavaScript enabled

For the static demo:
- Only a modern browser with JavaScript enabled

## Customization

You can customize the dashboard by:

1. Modifying the CSS in the `<style>` section of the HTML files.
2. Adjusting the PHP scripts to match your data structure.
3. Updating the JavaScript functions to handle your specific data format.

## Integrating with the Crawler

The dashboard is designed to work with the output format of the Playwright Web Crawler. If you modify the crawler's output format, you may need to update the dashboard's data handling logic to match.

## Known Issues

- The PHP version requires file access permissions to the output directory.
- Very large crawl datasets may cause performance issues in the browser.

## License

This dashboard is released under the same license as the Playwright Web Crawler.
